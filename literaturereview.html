    <h2>Mitigating personal information exposure on the web.</h2>
    <p class="BrakePara">
      In the modern day, more is being done on the web than ever done before, it has become a
      crucial part of everyone's lives. With this increased usage, people have come to rely on the
      web, but what is the extent of our digital footprint? This literature review shall analyse the
      academic research on reducing personal data exposure on the web. There are two major
      areas which this shall cover; what an individual, and corporations that hold these individual’s
      data can do to reduce the exposure of personal information on the web.
    </p>
    <p class="BrakePara">
      Social media has become a part of people's everyday lives and a large number of people
      entrust these sites with highly sensitive personal information on a regular basis. Linoff and
      Berry (2011) explain how data mining can be used to build a digital background on a person.
      However, this can be prevented or reduced in a few different ways; the best method would
      be to avoid using social media entirely. Although, less extreme options are available such as
      those mentioned by Barrett-Maitland (2016), one being establishing how the correct security
      measures around your account so third parties cannot view such information, thereby
      providing less of a reduced amount of data to build a background.
    </p>
    <p class="BrakePara">
      Additionally, Barrett-Maitland (2016) explains that organisations hold clients data. They
      suggest sending their user's regular emails “sensitising” their users to attacks and security
      threats. This establishes the ideas of data security and the possibility of an attack in the
      minds of their users so they are might be aware of the dangers of personal information
      exposure online. This links in with her earlier point advising better education for users on
      possible threat levels.
    </p>
    <p class="BrakePara">
      Even if settings on websites are set highly restrictive then there is still a large risk with the
      companies that are entrusted with personal data. There are many issues they could face
      such as having internal or external data leaks. There are many ways in which organisations
      can prevent from such breaches of their user's personal information, a good example would
      be providing SQL injection protection, this prevents attackers from requesting data from the
      site's databases using input boxes on the site such as the username box. The Information
      Commissioner's Office (2016) demonstrates a good example of this style attack: the
      TalkTalk attack, where 156,959 customers had personal information that they entrusted to
      TalkTalk to keep safe was accessed by attackers.
    </p>
    <p class="BrakePara">
      Furthermore, the system of using SQL authentication and XML authentication can be
      combined in a system between the web server and the database (Asha. N, M. Varun Kumar,
      Vaidhyanathan.G, 2012). This means that when SQL commands come in into the server
      from the user they are checked before being carried out in the database. Another common
      method for easy deployment is one where validation is carried out on all input to ensure that
      they don’t carry key parts of SQL commands. This is further implied by Clarke who
      demonstrates how a few simple lines of code can be used to check the input for a username
      for SQL injection statements (Clarke, 2012, 368-369). If a statement is detected then the
      string invalid username is outputted. Clarke later goes onto state that this form of prevention
      can be suitable for preventing an attack at the border it can get more complex when there
      are more inputs with different input types. They go onto suggest a way of resolving this
      however in a similar way but this time by blacklisting common keywords from SQL.
      SQL injection prevention can protect websites from outside attacks to a companies
      databases, however, they could still be at risk from internal data leaks: where an individual
      or group working within a company could gain access to data. Murad Ahmed and Guy
      Chazan explain how Microsoft is an example of a company that has adopted a data trustee
      system to manage the security of one of their new data centres (2015). This system uses a
      third party outside Microsoft to manage the security of the data centre ensuring that no one
      from Microsoft can access any of the personal data held within the centre without clearance
      from the data trustees. This helps prevent Microsoft employees from leaking personal data
      from the data centre.

    <p class="BrakePara">
      Every day people rely on many different web services and companies with their information,
      one of these main issues is peoples reliance on public WiFi networks as a means to access
      the internet. “Man-in-the-middle” style attacks are one of the most common types of attack to
      occur on public WiFi networks, it is explained well in (Hennigs, 2018) article where they
      intercept data from the access point before it reaches the user. This data could contain
      usernames and passwords for important services such as banks. The most logical way to
      avoid such attacks is to stay away from public WiFi networks, however this style of attack
      could come at a different point in the connection between the websites server and the user,
      meaning other measures would need to be taken into account such as end to end
      encryption, where data is encrypted for the whole journey from user to server.
      Another common way for attackers to gain data suggested by Peachar (2016) is website
      spoofing; where fake websites are set up to trick users into typing in sensitive information.
      However, there are ways to prevent against this style of attacks, for instance suggesting that
      URL checking tools could be used to ensure that the link the user is clicked on will take them
      to the website they desire (Pooja K. & Patel S. & Jagani C., 2013). However, some services
      like this such as “QuickCheck” can only be used a certain amount of times an hour, making it
      less practical for someone who uses the web for long periods of time. Kalola et al also have
      some good advice for avoiding attacks on critical systems such as bank accounts or
      accessing medical records, they recommend enabling a feature available within most
      browsers where the full URL can be seen, rather than a shortened version (2013). This
      enables the user to see exactly what website they are on. This feature can help easily
      identify whether or not the user had been redirected to a fake website set up by attackers to
      gain sensitive information.
